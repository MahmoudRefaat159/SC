Code Summary: Web Scraping Links & Submenus
This Python script extracts links and submenus from web pages and saves them in an Excel file.

Key Steps:
Imports:

selenium SC (for browser automation)

pandas (for Excel handling)

BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing)

Load URLs from URLS (2).xlsx.

Setup Chrome in headless mode (no GUI).

Fetch HTML from each URL.

Extract links & submenus using BeautifulSoup:

Gets <a> tags (links).

Checks for nested <ul> (submenus).

Save to Excel (Extractions_URLS.xlsx) with headers:

Link Text | URL | Submenu 1 | Submenu 2 | ...

How It Works:
Opens each URL in Chrome (hidden).

Scrapes links and submenu items.

Structures data in a table format.

Exports to Excel automatically.

Output: Organized list of links + submenus for analysis.



Simplified Code Summary SC1
This Python script extracts links and their submenus from multiple websites and saves them to an Excel file.

Key Components:

Input: Reads URLs from "URLS.xlsx"

Processing:

Fetches HTML content using requests

Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup

Extracts:

Main links (first 35 <a> tags)

Any submenu links (nested <ul> under parent <li>)

Output: Saves to "Extractions_URLS.xlsx" with columns:

Original URL

Link text

Link URL

Submenu items (if any)

Key Improvements Over Previous Version:

Uses requests instead of Selenium (lighter/faster)

Still handles nested submenus

Maintains same Excel output structure

Execution Flow:

Load URLs from Excel

For each URL:

Fetch HTML

Extract links + submenus

Format data

Combine all results and export to Excel






Code Explanation: JSON Data Extraction to CSV
This Python script fetches JSON data from a Databricks partner API, extracts specific fields, and saves them to a CSV file.

Key Components
Imports:

requests - For making HTTP requests

json - For handling JSON data (though response.json() is used directly)

pandas (pd) - For data structuring and CSV export

datetime - Imported but unused (could be for timestamping)

Configuration:

filename = "Data.csv" - Output file name

counter = 1 - Tracks processed entries (for console logging)

Data Fetching:

python
response = requests.get('https://www.databricks.com/en-partners-assets/data/partner/c&si-partner/en.json')
data_out = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
Data Extraction:

Loops through JSON entries (data_out).

Skips entries where fieldUrl is None.

Extracts:

title (stored in ti list)

URL path from fieldUrl.url.path (stored in ul list)

Prints a counter for progress tracking.

Data Structuring & Export:

python
data = {'Title': ti, 'URL': ul}
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Title', 'URL'])
df.to_csv(filename, index=False)  # Save to CSV without row numbers
print("Done")  # Completion message
Output
A CSV file (Data.csv) with two columns:

Title (from JSON title field)

URL (from nested fieldUrl.url.path)

Key Improvements
Lightweight (uses requests instead of Selenium/BS4).

Efficiently filters out None URLs.

Simple CSV output for easy analysis.
